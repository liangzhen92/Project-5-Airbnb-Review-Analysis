# AirBnb Review Analysis

Imagine if you are a host in airbnb, the number of reviews you get can be in hundreds or even thousands. What would you do to summarize customer review topics? And how to determine if it is a positive or negative one? 

To address this problem, i utilized topic modeling and trained Word2Vec feature to predict review scores.

* **Text Processing**: Tokenization and Cleaning (remove stop words, lemmatization, named entity recognition)

* **NLP**: Word2Vec

* **Topic Modeling**: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Non-nagative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 

* **Review Score Prediction**: Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Bayes, SVM, Random Forest
